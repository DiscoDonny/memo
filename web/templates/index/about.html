    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <div>
        <h3>Where can I report a bug or feature request?</h3>
        The <a href="https://memo.cash/topic/memo">memo topic</a> is a good place to report issues.
        You can also use any of the contact methods above.
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Does Memo have access to my private keys?</h3>
        Private keys are stored encrypted with the user's Memo password.
        The key needs to be unencrypted to sign transactions. Memo does not have
        access to the private keys, so it is critical for users to keep a backup in
        case the Memo password is lost.
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>What are the implications of posting to a public blockchain?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Memo actions (post, like, follow, tip) are public and visible to anyone.
                This is similar to some other social media, but there is a critical difference: <i>there are no delete or
                    edit functions</i> because blockchain data is immutable. We assume that in the future there will be a need to
                give more options on the Memo website about user intent, but the fact would remain that any action is permanently
                written to the blockchain and exists there for anyone to read. Keep this in mind while using Memo!</li>
            <li><strong>Portability</strong>: Your Memo account is controlled with a Bitcoin Cash address. You can use the
                same address with any application implementing Memo protocol or with a Bitcoin Cash wallet. This means
                you are in complete control of the actions and data associated with the address. </li>
        </ul>

        and <span class="blue">blue</span> with a star means you directly follow that user.

        The <a href="protocol">Memo protocol</a> and <a href="https://github.com/memocash/memo">the website</a>
        are open source. We have not created other clients yet, but anyone can build a new one using the specification.
